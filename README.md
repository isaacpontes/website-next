# Hi, I'm Isaac! :)

I am a full stack web developer from São Fidélis, Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. I love using technologies like PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript to create awesome websites and applications that solve real world problems.

## Skills

- **PHP:** I use it on a daily basis, specialy with the **Laravel** framework, for creating the backend of my projects, and sometimes even the frontend too. I have also worked with **Wordpress** in the past, and still do when I feel it's the right tool for the job.
- **HTML and CSS:** As a full stack developer, I have experience with HTML and CSS. I'm always trying to write semantic markup and style it in an organized and elegant way, paying atention to **UI and UX** guidelines to make sure my pages are beautyful and effective. I sometimes also use a few CSS frameworks to help me, like **Bootstrap 4**, **Bulma**, and **Tailwind**.
- **Javascript:** I recently started to delve deeper into the Javascript ecossystem, learning trending technologies like **React** and **Next.js**, and also **Node.js** and **Express** for building applications' backend. I am still a beginner, but I'm working hard and enjoying every new discovery.
- **Database:** I normaly use **MySQL** for the databases of my applications and websites, but have used **PostgreSQL** in the past. I also recently started to study more about **NoSQL** with **MongoDB**.
- **Web Server:** I have used **Apache** and **NGINX** for some of the applications I deployed at DigitalOcean in the past, but I still know only the basics and plan to learn more about them in the future.
