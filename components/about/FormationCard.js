          Bachelor in Information Systems by the Fluminense Federal Institute

          During the course I had the opportunity to get familiar with various topics,
          both in the area of software development, such as data structures, object-oriented
          programming, etc., as well as related areas, such as mathematics and administration.
          Despite going quickly through some more advanced topics such as artificial
          intelligence and internet of things, when I finished the course I chose to go deeper
          into the development of web applications.

          I was already familiar with the information technology area since I was young,
          but this was my first significant academic experience. Despite being primarily
          focused on the infrastructure area, the course also covered a little bit about
          algorithms and programming languages, which caught up my attention and later on
          led me to the information systems degree.
